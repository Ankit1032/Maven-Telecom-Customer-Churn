Customer Chrun Points

#The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s products or services during a particular time period is called a customer churn (attrition) rate. 
Examples of customer churn includes
	1. Cancelation of a subscription
	2. Closure of an account
	3. Non-renewal of a contract or service agreement
	4. Decision to shop at another store
	5. Use another service provider

#One of the ways to calculate a churn rate is to divide the number of customers lost during a given time interval by the number of acquired customers, and then multiply that number by 100 percent. 
#For example, if you got 150 customers and lost three last month, then your monthly churn rate is 2 percent.

#n a subscription-based business, even a small rate of monthly/quarterly churn will compound quickly over time. Just 1 percent monthly churn translates to almost 12 percent yearly churn. Given that it’s far more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, businesses with high churn rates will quickly find themselves in a financial hole as they have to devote more and more resources to new customer acquisition.

#Questions
Will this customer churn or not?
Will a customer renew their subscription?
Will a user downgrade a pricing plan?
Are there any signs of unusual customer behavior?
The fourth question about atypical behavior signs represents a type of a classification problem called anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is about identifying outliers – data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the data.

# Here are 6 time-tested steps to make sure you are focusing on retaining your customers — we are going to focus only on step 2 and parts of step 3 for this article. While at this, remember that this is not about blaming the product or customer success group for the churn but to create a strategy to improve customer retention.
	1. Gather available customer behavior, transactions, demographics data and usage patterns.
	2. Utilize these data points to predict customer segments who are likely to churn.
	3. Create a model to pattern the risk tolerance of the business with respect to churn probability.
	4. Design an intervention model to consider how the level of intervention could affect the churn percentages and customer lifetime value (CLV).
	5. Implement effective experimentation across multiple customer segments for reducing churn and promoting retention.
	6. Rinse and Repeat from Step 1 (cognitive churn management is a continuous process and not once a year exercise).

====== Tasks todo in the dataset =====
1. Study the behaviour of "Customer Status" = Churned and analysis their behaviour

2. Study the behaviour of "Customer Status" = Stayed and analysis their behaviour
	a. also depeneds on how long they stayed which can be identified from "Tenure in Months"
	
3. Make a skew diagram and find mean,median,mode of Tenure in Months which would tell us how long a customer stays
	a. differentiate between churned/stayed
	
4. Find out which demographic looses least/most people.

5. Find out the usage pattern of the people.
	a. mostly which services are used the most

6. Find out churn probability 

7. Create a month on month tenure vs Monthly Charge
	a. you know this data ends at 2nd Quarter of 2022 so you can find the starting month of those customers approx.
	
8. Find out whats the % Quarterly revenue the customers ("Customer Status" = Stayed) are generating currently

9. Find all categorical and numerical columns [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]

10. Make a pie chart of Customer Status  (to be called churn rate) [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
	a. Not churned% -> stayed/joined
	b. Churned% -> churned
	
11. Plot Bar chart
	- Churn rate by Dependents
	- Churn rate by Senior Citizen/Young Citizen
	- 
	
12. Use Scatterplot(using laitude and longitude) to mark the customers on bases on customer status [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]

	
13. Make a bar chart for all Services

14. Make bar chart of : (the conclusion might come to : The shorter the contract, the higher the churn rate)[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
	a. Contract
	b. Paperless Billing
	c. Payment Method

15. Plot Histogram of all numeric features
	- Tenure 
	-
